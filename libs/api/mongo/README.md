# api-mongo

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev) for api-mongo/api-mongoose utilities.

Nest Global ExceptionFilters do not seem to apply to import Libs.
So we keep it separate and manually add a `@UseFilters()` directive
in the appropriate controllers.

## Building

Run `nx build api-mongo` to build the library.
