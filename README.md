## Setup

Prerequisites

- npm
- nx
- docker
- k3d

## Local Development

Repo setup

```
git clone ...
cd booklog
npm install
```

```
docker run mongo -p 27027:27017 -t booklog-db
MONGO_PORT=27017 npm run serve
```

## Local Deployment

1. Install k3d
2. Initialize a new cluster with appropriate port forwarded
   `k3d cluster create booklog -p "3000:32001@agent:0" --agents 2`
3. Build Docker images
   `nx docker-build api`
   `nx docker-build client`
4. Import images into k3d cluster
   `k3d image import booklog-api -c booklog -m direct`
   `k3d image import booklog-client -c booklog -m direct`
5. Ensure `kubectl` context is correct
   `kubectl config current-context #k3d-booklog`
6. Apply kubernetes resources
   `kubectl apply -f ./deploy/`

## Caveats

- Normally you'd want to have an 'author' collection, but I opted to just go without for ease of implementation.
- Tests are minimal.
- kubernetes resources has no ingress, we are instead using a NodePort (not recommend for production).
- I wanted to try out k3d over minikube, but I think for long term use you'd want to set up the k3d registries so you don't need to import images manually.
